I am a first-year Data Science Ph.D. student at University of Virginia. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Chirag Agarwal](https://chirag-agarwall.github.io/). My research interest focuses on graph representation learning, explainable AI, and AI4Science. I enjoy playing tennis, soccer, and piano! I am working "hard" on learning guitar...
